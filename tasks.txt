Reproducibility tasks: 
- Please read the paper and understand the overall approach and evaluation methodology. 
- In particular, implement the algorithm based on the definition in Section 2, Shared-based Optimization (through query rewriting) in Section 4.1, 
- and Pruning-based Optimization (using Hoeffding-Serfling inequality) in Section 4.2.
- In evaluation, use the census data set. 
- Set the user-specified query to include the married people, and the reference query to include unmarried people.
- Use the K-L Divergence as the utility measure.
- Find top-5 aggregate views by the utility measure. The plots should look like those illustrated in Figure 1.
